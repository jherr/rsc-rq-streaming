Simple test app to show streaming promises in the App Router with ReactQuery. It's pretty slick. It looks like the RSC infra is marshalling promises on both sides and that slots really nicely into RQ's promise handling.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
